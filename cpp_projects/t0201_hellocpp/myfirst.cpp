// #include is handled before compilation (by the preprocessor).
// The preprocessor replaces the #include directive with the contents of the specified file.
// <iostream> is part of the C++ Standard Library.
// It provides input and output functionality, such as reading from the keyboard and writing to the console.
#include <iostream> 

// The "using namespace std;" directive allows us to use standard library features without the "std::" prefix.
// It is a common practice in C++ programs to simplify code readability.
// However, in larger projects, it is often better to use the "std::" prefix to avoid name conflicts.
// This directive is not strictly necessary, but it is often used for convenience.
// The "std" namespace contains all the standard C++ library features.
using namespace std; 

// The main function is the entry point of a C++ program.
// It is where the program starts executing.
// The return type of main is int, which indicates that the function returns an integer value.
// The return value of 0 typically indicates successful execution.
int main()
{
    // TODO: Replace the following line so that the program prints "Hello, world!" (without quotes) and a new line to the screen.
    // Use the appropriate function from the <iostream> library.
